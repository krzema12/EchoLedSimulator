Hey, this is just a GIF, here's live demo: https://krzema12.github.io/EchoLedSimulator/

# Echo LED Simulator

This simple web app lets you manipulate individual LEDs of a mocked [Amazon Echo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkOCeAtKHIc), and ultimately create animations in a declarative manner.
You just specify how each of 12 LEDs should look like in a particular moment, and the rest is done by the framework.

If you want to add your own animation, see [Animation Registry definition](js/animationRegistry.js).


**Protip: for best performance, use Google Chrome.**
